Hi 👋🏻,

I'm Ignacio and welcome to my space on the web where I ocassionally write
articles about a variety of different topics related to software and data engineering.

I'm passionate about open-source initiatives and philosophy so I participate in projects when I have the opportunity.
As an example, I received an award for an [open data project](http://ipeluffo.github.io/itba-bigdata-final-2015/) from the local government of Bahia Blanca, Argentina.

Everything published on this blog is open and free to everyone and helps me to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).

If you want to contact me, it's best to reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciopeluffo/).
